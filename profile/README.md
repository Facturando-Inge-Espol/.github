# UrbaPass system
UrbaPass has a mobile and web application for administrating payments and visits in an urbanization. The mobile application has a user who is the resident who must be authenticated through a login, once inside the user must be able to pay an aliquot, see the expenses of the urbanization and generate an invitation, which is a QR that the resident will give to the guest.
The QR must be scanned by a QR scanner at the time the guest arrives at the urbanization and then their access will be allowed.
The web application works as a control panel, which will have two users, the administrator, and the guard. Within this control panel, the administrator can register residents of the urbanization and a guard. He will also be able to view the payments made by transfers and the invitations granted by the residents. The guard will only be able to observe the invitations granted by the residents, so that in case the QR scanner does not read the QR code correctly, the guard can check the data of the person who enters.
